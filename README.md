# Raindrop

A project with the goal of finding whether a number has the factors 3, 5 and 7.

If a factor of 3 is found `Pling` will be outputted, 5 has `Plang`, and 7 has `Plong`.

The results can be concatenated as well, for example, the number 30 has a factor of 3 and 5 thefore `PlingPlang` will be outputted.
